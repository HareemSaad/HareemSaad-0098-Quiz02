how to operate:

1- deploy both tokens separately

    i- comet has an unlimited total supply
  
    ii- pluto has a fixed total supply
  
2-before deploying nft remeber to set the deployer's address as it is not chanagable

3-to mint using erc tokens user has to first approve the nft contract instance from the token instance they want to use
for e.g. if they want to use pluto to mint nft they have to approve nft's contract instance address in pluto's contract.

4- user must have token's contract address to mint
